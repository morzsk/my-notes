## Chapter 1. The Day JavaScript Broke

***[Scene opens in complete silence. A black screen lingers for a moment before a single white cursor blinks in the center. The hum of a server room fades in. Cut to a close-up of a terminal window, text rapidly scrolling—a software build in progress]***

**NARRATOR (calm, deliberate):**  
It started with eleven lines of code.

***[Hard cut to a busy San Francisco startup office, 2016. Developers furrow their brows, eyes darting between screens. The sound of frantic keyboard clacking.]***

Eleven… seemingly trivial lines, buried within millions across the internet.
 
***[A developer hits "Enter." Cut to a progress bar—it freezes. A terminal spits out an error message in angry red text: `npm ERR! 404 'left-pad' is not in the npm registry`]***

And then—everything broke.

**[The hum of the server room is replaced by silence. A notification sound pings. Then another. And another. A flood of Slack messages, GitHub issues, Twitter outrage.]** 

By the time anyone realised what had happened, the damage was already done.

**[Montage: DevOps engineers staring in horror at their dashboards. npm install scripts failing en masse. A frantic blog post being drafted: _What Happened to Left-Pad?_]**

A single package, yanked from the registry, sent shockwaves through the entire JavaScript ecosystem. It exposed a terrifying truth—one the tech industry had long ignored.

**[Cut to black. One line of text fades in, letter by letter, in an eerie, monospaced font:]**

Just how fragile is the internet?

**[Music swells. Cut to the opening scene of the story.]**

## Chapter 2. Azer

_**[A panoramic drone shot of a small town on the Turkish-Iraqi border. Dry, mountainous terrain stretches into the horizon. Children run through the dusty streets. The distant sound of a news broadcast crackles from a radio.]**_

**NARRATOR:**  
Our story begins far from Silicon Valley, in a small town near the Turkish-Iraqi border.

It was here that **Azer Koçulu** was born—a world away from the fast-paced tech industry he would one day disrupt.

_**[Cut to archival footage: A war-torn landscape. Smoke rising in the distance. Civilians walking through rubble.]**_

For Azer, childhood was anything but ordinary. He grew up in a region marked by conflict, where armed skirmishes between the Turkish government and the **PKK** were a common reality.

War was not something he read about in history books. It was happening around him.

_**[Cut to a dimly lit classroom. A teacher slams a ruler on a desk. Students flinch.]**_

His school life was no less brutal. Teachers would beat students. Children of government officials were given special treatment, placed in separate classes.

And because Azer spoke Arabic, he was bullied—ostracized for something as simple as the language he spoke.

_**[Cut to Azer walking alone, head down, through a narrow alleyway.]**_

Aimless. Isolated. Adrift.

_**[The scene changes. A bright coastal town. A calm breeze rustles through trees.]**_

But then—something changed.

His family moved to a quieter town. Life became a little more stable.

And that’s when Azer discovered the **Internet.**

## Chapter 2. The Internet

_**[Cut to a 90s-era CRT monitor. A web page loads, pixel by pixel, on a dial-up connection. It’s an old personal website, with a flashy banner: _I Kiss You!_ by Mahir Çağrı.]**_

**NARRATOR:**  
It started with **İnternet Mahir**—a Turkish man whose bizarre website, _IKissYou.com_, made him a viral sensation.

For Azer, the idea was intoxicating:  
Could someone from his hometown—someone with no connections, no privilege—suddenly become famous on the internet?

The question **consumed him.**

_**[Cut to a stack of magazines, computer CDs piled on top.]**_

He devoured **computer magazines, internet guides, anything he could get his hands on.**

Eventually, he got a computer. And a desk.

And with it—an entire world opened up.

_**[The sound of a keyboard clicking. Lines of PHP code appear on screen.]**_

He learned to program, starting with **PHP.** He built his first websites, crude as they were.

But they were just that, he couldn’t afford hosting or publishing them.

And then, **he met the man who would change his life forever.**

## Chapter 3 Muhammad Daud

His name was **Muhammed Daud**—an illegal Iraqi immigrant.

Through **MSN Messenger**, Daud became Azer’s mentor.

He bought Azer his **first domain name and web hosting.**

He answered **every beginner programming question.**  
How to connect PHP scripts to MySQL.  
How to search effectively on Google.  
How to solve problems—**not just in code, but in life.**

When he finally got his first job Daud would translate communications for him.

_**[Cut to Azer receiving an email. He stares at the screen, hands hovering over the keyboard.]**_

When Azer later reached out to thank him, Daud had only **one request.**

**MUHAMMED DAUD (voiceover, soft):**  
_"Help others."_

It was that simple.

_**[Cut to a shot of Azer, years later, sitting in his apartment in Oakland, staring out the window.]**_

**NARRATOR:**  
Azer never forgot those words.

> _"He helped me because he wanted people to help each other."_

And years later, sitting in his home in California, he would reflect on how that one act of kindness changed everything.

_**[Screen fades to black. A quote appears, typed out in monospaced text.]**_

> Now sitting in my home in Oakland, and thinking about how I got into programming, how I took a loan from a bank and moved to US to start a new life here, I realize that I owe my career to Muhammed Daud.
## **Chapter 4: Open Source and Ideals**

_**[Cut to Azer speaking at a tech conference. The camera zooms in on a slide: “Open Source: A Philosophy.”]**_

Azer’s journey led him deep into **the open-source world**. He idolize the philosophy of figures like **Richard Stallman**, the father of Free Software.

To him, **software was meant to be free, open, and community-driven.**

> _"I'm a self-taught high school graduate who learned everything thanks to open-source. I owe everything I have to the people who never gave up on its philosophy."_

It was this idealism—this deep-seated belief in **freedom over control**—that would set the stage for one of the biggest controversies in modern software history.

Our story starts in Turkey, a man named Azer Coklu was born in a small town bordering Iraq

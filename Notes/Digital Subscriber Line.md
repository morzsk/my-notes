## What is a Digital Subscriber Line

**What is a Digital Subscriber line**
â†“
- When [[Host]]Telco is their [[Internet Service Provider]]
- DSL Modem uses existing Telephone line (twisted pair copper wire)
<!--SR:!2025-01-01,16,292-->

**What is a Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer**
â†“
- Located at Telcoâ€™s Local Central office
<!--SR:!2024-12-22,6,230-->

**How is data sent from DSL to DSLAM**
â†“
- Homes DSL model takes digital data
- Translate it into high-frequency tones
- Analog signals are transmitted and translated back at DSLAM
<!--SR:!2025-01-01,16,292-->

- Telephone lines carry both data and traditional telephone signals
- Encoded at different frequencies

**What bands in a single Telephone line**
1. High speed downstream
2. Medium speed upstream
3. Ordinary two-way telephone
â†“
 **High speed downstream channel band**
â†“
 - 50 kHz to 1 MHz band
<!--SR:!2024-12-30,14,292-->

**Medium speed upstream channel band**
â†“
- 4 kHz to 50 kHz
<!--SR:!2024-12-31,15,292-->

**Ordinary two-way telephone channel band**
â†“
- 0 to 4 kHz band
<!--SR:!2024-12-30,14,292-->

**How are telephone and data bands seperated**
â†“
- Using a splitter
<!--SR:!2024-12-19,12,288-->

**What does asymmetric transmission mean**
â†“
- When downstream and upstream is different
<!--SR:!2025-01-01,16,292-->

**What distance is DSL**
â†“
 - When there is short distance to Central Office (5 to 10 m)

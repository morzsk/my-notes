## What is a Lowest Common Multiple

**What is a Lowest Common Multiple**
â†“
- The smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both $a$ and $b$

**How to find the LCM of a group of numbers**
â†“
- The LCM is the product of the highest power of each prime factor that appears in the [[Prime Factorisation]]
$$
\begin{align}
24=2^3 \cdot 3^1 \text{, } 90= 2^1 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^1 \\
lcm(24, 90) = 2^3 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^1 = 360
\end{align}
$$

**Relationship Between the Least Common Multiple (LCM) and Common Multiples**
â†“
- Let $a$ and $b$ be positive integers
- Every multiple of $lcm(a, b)$ is a common multiple of $a$ and $b$ is a multiple of $lcm(a, b)$

**Factorising LCM function**
â†“
For any positive integer $a$, $b$ and $n$ we have $$lcm(na,nb) = nlcm(a, b)$$

**Prime Divisibility**
â†“
If a number is not [[divisible]] by a prime, then it is not divisible by any multiple of that [[Prime Number]]
<!--SR:!2025-02-08,62,290-->

**Prime Testing**
â†“
We only need to test whether number is divisible by prime number
<!--SR:!2025-01-06,30,290-->

**Square Root Bound for Primes**
â†“
- Check if prime number squares is less than or equal to the number weâ€™re testing
$$p^2 \leq n$$

**Why does Square root bounds for prime testing work**
â†“
- If $n$ is not prime, it must be divisible by $a$ and $b$
$$n=a \cdot b$$

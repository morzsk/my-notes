## What are Systems of Equation

**What are Systems of Equations**
â†“
- Multiple related [[Equations]]
<!--SR:!2025-01-22,64,310-->

- If a system of equations has a solution 
- They can be found by repeatedly removing variables

**Techniques for solving Systems of Equations**
â†“
1. [[Substitution]]
2. [[Elimination]]
<!--SR:!2025-08-17,253,330-->


**Consistent System**
â†“
- System with at least one solution
<!--SR:!2024-12-20,8,210-->

**Inconsistent System**
â†“
- System with no solution
<!--SR:!2025-02-20,93,312-->

**Linear Combination**
â†“
- Multiply two equations by different constants and add them
<!--SR:!2024-12-11,4,210-->

**Dependent System**
â†“
- When a linear equation is a linear combination of the others
- Also known as redundant equation
<!--SR:!2024-12-13,6,250-->

**Independent System**
â†“
- When no linear equation in a system is a linear combination of the others
<!--SR:!2024-12-17,5,152-->

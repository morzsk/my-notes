## What is a Multiple

**What is a Multiples**
â†“
$a$ is a multiple of $b$ if $a$ equals $b$ times some integer (where $b$ and $n$ are Factors) 
$$a=bn$$

## Counting Multiples

**What happens if you start from multiple of $n$ and count up or down by $n$?**
â†“
- You'll always land on another multiple of $n$
	- It's like stepping on a number line where every step is exactly $n$ units, so you're only hitting multiples of $n$ along the way

**What happens if $a$ and $b$ are both multiples of $c$?  Think $a+b$ or $a-b$**
â†“
- Both $a+b$,  and $aâˆ’b$ will also be multiples of $c$
	- Itâ€™s like combining or subtracting two stacks of items where each stack has a number of items divisible by $c$
	- The total or difference will always be divisible by $c$ too!

**What happens if you start from a multiple of $n$ and count up or down by a number thatâ€™s not a multiple of $n$?**
â†“
- It wont be a multiple

**What is an Algorithm**
â†“
- Any well-defined computational process
- That takes some input and produces an output
- in finite time
<!--SR:!2025-05-15,172,310-->

**What is an instance**
â†“
- Inputs (which fit within problems constraints)
- Usually a [[Algorithmic Key]] in some [[Data Structure]]
- Needed to compute solution
<!--SR:!2025-03-05,79,290-->

**What is a correct algorithm**
â†“
- For every instance, it halts its computing, in finite time
- Halts for all instances (not some or incorrect)
<!--SR:!2025-08-16,251,330-->

**Efficiency**
â†“
- Primary concern is number of items
- Independent constant is less of a concern
$$Eff=cn$$

## Counting Divisors

**If $a$ divides $b$, what can you say about the divisors of $a$?**
â†“
If $a$ is a divisor of $b$, then every divisor of $a$ is also a divisor of $b$
<!--SR:!2024-12-21,46,290-->

**What happens if $c$ divides both $a$ and $b$? Think $a+b$ and $aâˆ’b$?**
â†“
If $c$ is a divisor of $a$ and $b$, then $c$ is a divisor of $a+b$ and of $a-b$

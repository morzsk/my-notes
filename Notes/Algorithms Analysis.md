**What is Algorithm Analysis**
â†“
- Compare different [[Algorithm]] for the same task
- Predict performance in a new environment
- Set values of algorithm parameters

- [[Loop Invariant]]

## Types of Analysis

**Empirical Analysis**
â†“
<!--SR:!2024-12-27,11,288-->

**Mathematical Analysis**
â†“
<!--SR:!2024-12-25,9,250-->

**Problems in precise Algorithmic Analysis**
â†“
1. e.g. C program translated into machine code
	- That C statement can take diff time to execute
	- Resources may be shared, machine code is machine dependent
2. Performance can vary based on input
3. Many algorithms havenâ€™t been studied in depth
4. Two programs might not be comparable

**Steps of Algorithmic Analysis**
â†“
1. Identify the abstract operation an algorithm is based on
	- Separating analysis and implementation
2. Use profile mechanisms (instruction-frequency counts)
	- To determine most frequency executed part of codes

**Actual Data**
â†“
- What would actually happen
<!--SR:!2024-12-27,11,288-->

**Random Data**
â†“
- For average-case performance
<!--SR:!2024-12-26,10,288-->

**Perverse Data**
â†“
- For worst-case performance

## Overview
- Game Title: Mining Trajedy
- Genre: Action Shooter
- Platform: Roblox, pc, mobile, console
- Target Audience: 

### Summary
You just got a once-in-a-lifetime offer from the company.

The benefits are incredible—high pay, full coverage, and the chance to visit exotic alien worlds. 

You’ll be working in a tight-knit team, operating cutting-edge mining equipment, and handling… weapons? That part wasn’t in the initial pitch, heh, but hey, better safe than sorry, right? 

The job is simple: extract valuable resources and bring them back. No big deal. Just don’t ask too many questions

– Especially about why the last crew didn’t make it back, and ignore the emergency protocols buried in the contract. It’s probably just a formality.

##  Gameplay  Mechanics

Mine resources –> Refine/Process –> Sell —> Repeat till we reach goal –> Big payout

Blockers
- Harder rocks
- Monster

Helpers
- Teamwork

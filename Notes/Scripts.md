Ok gamers, we’re in the year 2024, Chatgpt exists meaning your code monkey ass is on the chopping board. So if you want to become a full stack engineer you’re going to need actual deep understanding of software development.

So obviously we need to go a step deeper, and learn C one of the most bare bone modern programming languages to appreciate what goes on under the hood of our programming languages and hardware.

But truly understand C we have to look at assembly to understand a machine dependent language and get a truly deep understanding of the CPU.

But to even go there it’s good to have an understanding of the underlying Binary and Circuitry because ultimately computers are the sum of their parts and their parts are the circuits that make it up.

But to understand Circuity in any real sense we need to know electricity and magnetism.

But what is electricity what is an electron? How can we understand it truly without looking at the Quantum realm.

And with that how do we even know that we know what an electron is? How do we that the way we perceive reality is real? Why does it even matter to know what an electron is?

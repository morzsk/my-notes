## What is the Feynman Learning Technique

## [The Technique](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/)
1. **Pretend to teach a concept to a kid**
	- Create a note for the subject you want to master
	- Try explaining using basic terms a kid could understand
	- Write down or record everything though
2. **Identify gaps in your explanation**
	- Any jargon
	- Any gaps between concepts
	- Identify boundaries of [[Circle of competence]]
3. **Go back and fill in those gaps**
	- Look up definitions
	- Look at concept as a whole and not its parts
	- Think about how these all relate to each other
4. **Organise and simplify**
	- Now read revised note from beginning to end
	- If at any point there is confusion go back to step 2
	- Then collect the final note together
5. **Transmit**
	- The ultimate test of your knowledge is your capacity to convey it to another

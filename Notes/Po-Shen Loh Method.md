## What is The Po-Shen Loh Method

**What do we know about the roots of a quadratic**
â†“
-  $x^2-(r+s)x+rs$ by [[Vietaâ€™s Formula]]
- We can get midpoint by getting [[Arithmetic Mean]] of roots
- We can get the distance squared as difference of two squares
- We can represent roots as a distance $\pm$ the midpoint

**How do we get the midpoint**
â†“
$$
\begin{align}
b'&=(-r+s) \\
m&=\frac{r+s}{2}=-\frac{b'}{2} \\
\end{align}
$$
 
 **How do we get the distance**
 â†“
 $$
\begin{align}
c'&=rs \\
c'&=(m-d)(m+d) \\
&= m^{2}-d^{2} \\
d^{2}&=m^{2}-c'
\end{align}
$$
 
**How do we get the roots**
â†“
$$
r,s=m\pm d

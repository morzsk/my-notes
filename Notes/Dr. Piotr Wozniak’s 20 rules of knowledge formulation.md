## What is Dr. Piotr Wozniakâ€™s 20 rules of knowledge formulation

## [Dr Piotr Wozniakâ€™s 20 rules of formulation Knowledge](https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm)
1. **Do not learn learn if you donâ€™t understand** 
	- A history textbook written in German can  book can be crammed word for word. 
	- The time needed for such "blind learning" is astronomical. 
	- If you cram a German book on history, you will still know nothing of history.
2. **Learn before you memorise**
	- Do not start from memorizing loosely related facts! 
	- First read a chapter in your book that puts them together (e.g.Â _the principles of the internal combustion engine_). 
	- Only then proceed with learning using individual questions and answers (e.g.Â _What moves the pistons in the internal combustion engine?)
3. **Build upon basics**
	- The simpler the picture the better. The shorter the initial chapter of your book the better. 
	- Simple models are easier to comprehend. You can always build upon them later on
4. **Stick to minimum information principle**
	- Simple is easy
	- Repetitions of simple items are easier to schedule
		- Create items that could easily be split intoÂ **ten or more**Â simpler sub-items

5. **Cloze deletion is easy and effective**
	- _Cloze deletion_Â is a sentence with its parts missing and replaced by three dots
		- ![[Pasted image 20240829102820.png]]
6. **Use imagery**
7. **Use Mnemonic Techniques**
8. **Graphic deletion is as good as cloze deletion**
	- Graphic deletion works likeÂ but instead of a missing phrase it uses a missing image component
	- When learning anatomy, you might present a complex illustration. Only a small part of it would be missing 
		- ![[Pasted image 20240829104354.png]]
9. **Avoid sets**
	- Â An example of an item that is difficult to learn is an item that asks for the list of the members of a set
	- If sets are absolutely necessary, you should always try to convert them intoÂ enumerations
		- ![[Pasted image 20240829104640.png]]
10. **Avoid enumeration**
	- Deal with them usingÂ cloze deletionsÂ (overlapping cloze deletions if possible) 
	- Learning the alphabet can be a good example of an overlapping cloze deletion:
		- ![[Pasted image 20240829104802.png]]
	- Due to strong semantic connections, the rhyme and the rhythm, it may often be possible to effectively remember poems without using cloze deletion
		- ![[Pasted image 20240829104957.png]]
	- However, once you notice you stumble with your poem, use cloze deletion
11. **Combat  memory Interference**
	- If knowledge of one item makes it harder to remember another item
	- The only hermetic procedure against it is toÂ **detect and eliminate**.
12. **Optimise wording**
	- Items must be optimised to make sure that in minimum time the right bulb in your brain lights up
		- ![[Pasted image 20240829120502.png]]
13. **Refer to other memories**
14. **Personalise and provide examples**
	- One of the most effective ways of enhancing memories is to provide them with a link to your personal life
		- ![[Pasted image 20240829120859.png]]
15. **Rely on sensual/emotional states**
	- Â Illustrate your items with examples that are vivid or even shocking, you are likely to enhance retrieval
		- ![[Pasted image 20240829121142.png]]
16. **Context cues simplify wording**
	- ![[Pasted image 20240829121751.png]]
17. **Redundancy does not contradict minimum information principle**
	- **Redundancy**Â in simple terms is more information than needed or duplicate information,
	- **Passive and active approach**
	- **Reasoning cues**
	- **Derivation steps**
	- **Multiple semantic representation**
	- **Flexible repetition**
18. **Provide sources**
	 - In real-life situation you will often be confronted with challenges to your knowledge
	 - Sources should accompany your items but should not be part of the learned knowledge
19. **Provide date stamping**
	- Knowledge can be relatively stable (basic math, anatomy, taxonomy, physical geography, etc.)
	- Highly volatile (economic indicators, high-tech knowledge, personal statistics, etc.)
20. **Prioritise**
	-
